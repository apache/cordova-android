// This is an empty project used to provide Gradle Tooling
// Using the main project which loads AGP will enforce a minimum version
// requirement on the end-user, requiring a gradle install that satisfies AGP
// version requirements.
// To avoid that, we utilise this empty project of which we can
// freely run the gradle wrapper task against to obtain the 
// wrapper at the desired version, without being restricted by AGP's version
// requirements.
// Of course, the installed wrapper must still be of at least the minimum
// required version of AGP for the build to work correctly.
