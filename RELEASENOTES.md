### Release 4.0.0 (March 2015) ###

This release adds significant functionality, and also introduces a number
of breaking changes.  Some of the changes to the code base will be of
particular interest to plugin developers.

#### Major Changes ####
* Support for pluggable WebViews
  * The system WebView can be replaced in your app, via a plugin
  * Core WebView functionality is encapsulated, with extension points exposed
    via interfaces
* Support for Crosswalk to bring the modern Chromium WebView to older devices
  * Uses the pluggable WebView framework
  * You will need to add the new [cordova-crosswalk-engine](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/cordova-crosswalk-engine) plugin
* Splash screen functionality is now provided via plugin
  * You will need to add the new [cordova-plugin-splashscreen](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-splashscreen) plugin to continue using a splash screen
* Whitelist functionality is now provided via plugin (CB-7747)
  * The whitelist has been enhanced to be more secure and configurable
  * Setting of Content-Security-Policy is now supported by the framework (see details in plugin readme)
  * You will need to add the new [cordova-plugin-whitelist](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-whitelist) plugin
  * Legacy whitelist behaviour is still available via plugin (although not recommended).

Changes For Plugin Developers:

* Develop in Android Studio
  * Android Studio is now fully supported, and recommended over Eclipse
* Build using Gradle
  * All builds [use Gradle by default](Android%20Shell%20Tool%20Guide_building_with_gradle), instead of Ant
  * Plugins can add their own gradle build steps!
  * Plugins can depend on Maven libraries using `<framework>` tags
* New APIs: `onStart`, `onStop`, `onConfigurationChanged`
