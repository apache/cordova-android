  "readme": "# node-properties-parser\n\nA parser for [.properties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties) files written in javascript.  Properties files store key-value pairs.  They are typically used for configuration and internationalization in Java applications as well as in Actionscript projects.  Here's an example of the format:\n\n\t# You are reading the \".properties\" entry.\n\t! The exclamation mark can also mark text as comments.\n\twebsite = http://en.wikipedia.org/\n\tlanguage = English\n\t# The backslash below tells the application to continue reading\n\t# the value onto the next line.\n\tmessage = Welcome to \\\n\t          Wikipedia!\n\t# Add spaces to the key\n\tkey\\ with\\ spaces = This is the value that could be looked up with the key \"key with spaces\".\n\t# Unicode\n\ttab : \\u0009\n*(taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties#Format))*\n\nCurrently works with any version of node.js.\n\n## The API\n\n- `parse(text)`: Parses `text` into key-value pairs.  Returns an object containing the key-value pairs.\n- `read(path[, callback])`: Opens the file specified by `path` and calls `parse` on its content.  If the optional `callback` parameter is provided, the result is then passed to it as the second parameter.  If an error occurs, the error object is passed to `callback` as the first parameter. If `callback` is not provided, the file specified by `path` is synchronously read and calls `parse` on its contents.  The resulting object is immediately returned.\n- `createEditor([path[, callback]])`:  If neither `path` or `callback` are provided an empty editor object is returned synchronously.  If only `path` is provided, the file specified by `path` is synchronously read and parsed.  An editor object with the results in then immediately returned.  If both `path` and `callback` are provided, the file specified by `path` is read and parsed asynchronously.  An editor object with the results are then passed to `callback` as the second parameters.  If an error occurs, the error object is passed to `callback` as the first parameter.\n- `Editor`: The editor object is returned by `createEditor`.  Has the following API:\n\t- `get(key)`: Returns the value currently associated with `key`.\n\t- `set(key, [value[, comment]])`: Associates `key` with `value`. An optional comment can be provided. If `value` is not specified or is `null`, then `key` is unset.\n\t- `unset(key)`: Unsets the specified `key`.\n\t- `save([path][, callback]])`: Writes the current contents of this editor object to a file specified by `path`.  If `path` is not provided, then it'll be defaulted to the `path` value passed to `createEditor`.  The `callback` parameter is called when the file has been written to disk.\n\t- `addHeadComment`: Added a comment to the head of the file.\n\t- `toString`: Returns the string representation of this properties editor object.  This string will be written to a file if `save` is called.\n\n## Getting node-properties-parser\n\nThe easiest way to get node-properties-parser is with [npm](http://npmjs.org/):\n\n\tnpm install properties-parser\n\nAlternatively you can clone this git repository:\n\n\tgit://github.com/xavi-/node-properties-parser.git\n\n## Developed by\n* Xavi Ramirez\n\n## License\nThis project is released under [The MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).",
